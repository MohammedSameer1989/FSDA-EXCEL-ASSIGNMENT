    "Ans-Changing the height and width of cells in Excel can be necessary for several reasons:\n",
    "Text and Content Visibility: Adjusting the height and width of cells allows you to control how much text or content is visible within a cell. If the content within a cell is too long or wide to fit within the default cell size, increasing the height or width ensures that all content is fully visible.\n",
    "Formatting and Presentation: Customizing the height and width of cells can improve the formatting and presentation of your worksheet. By resizing cells, you can create a more visually appealing layout and ensure that your data is organized and easy to read.\n",
    "Alignment and Readability: Properly sized cells contribute to the alignment and readability of your data. Aligning text and content within cells becomes easier when you adjust the cell dimensions to accommodate the desired alignment and formatting.\n",
    "Merged Cells: If you have merged cells in your worksheet, adjusting the height and width of the merged cells may be necessary to ensure that the merged content is displayed correctly.\n",
    "Printing: When preparing a worksheet for printing, adjusting the height and width of cells can help optimize the layout and appearance of the printed document. This ensures that the printed version of your worksheet looks consistent with the on-screen version.\n",
    "Overall, changing the height and width of cells in Excel is essential for optimizing the layout, readability, and presentation of your data. It allows you to customize the appearance of your worksheet to meet specific requirements and ensure that your data is effectively communicated to your audience."

Select all the visible rows by clicking on the row numbers on the left side of the worksheet. Right-click on any of the selected row numbers and choose \"Hide\".\n",
    "This process hides the rows containing blank cells based on the filter criteria. Keep in mind that hiding rows in this way is a temporary action, and you can always unhide them later by removing the filter or using the \"Unhide\" command."

    "Apply Conditional Formatting:\n",
    "Go to the \"Home\" tab on the Excel ribbon.\n",
    "Click on \"Conditional Formatting\" in the \"Styles\" group.\n",
    "Choose \"New Rule\" from the dropdown menu.\n",
    "Create a New Rule:\n",

    "swift\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "=COUNTIF($A$1:$A$100, A1)>1\n",
    "Replace $A$1:$A$100 with the actual range of cells where your data is located, and A1 with the first cell in the selected range.\n",
    "Set the Format:\n",
    "Click on the \"Format\" button to choose the formatting style for the duplicate values. You can choose to change the font color, fill color, or apply any other formatting options.\n",
    "Once you've selected the desired format, click \"OK\" to close the \"Format Cells\" dialog box.\n",
    "Apply Formatting:\n",
    "After setting the format, click \"OK\" in the \"New Formatting Rule\" dialog box to apply the conditional formatting.\n",
    "Now, any duplicate values in the selected range will be formatted according to the chosen format, making them visually distinguishable from non-duplicate values. You can adjust the range and formatting options as needed to fit your specific requirements. Keep in mind that this method does not technically hide the duplicate values but rather formats them differently to make them stand out visually. If you want to hide the duplicate values altogether, you can apply a filter or use other methods after identifying them with conditional formatting."
