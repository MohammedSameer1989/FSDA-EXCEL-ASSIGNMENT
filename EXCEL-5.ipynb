    "Ans-In Excel, there are several types of conditions available for conditional formatting. These conditions allow you to format cells based on specific criteria or rules. Here are the main types of conditions you can use in conditional formatting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell Value: Format cells based on their numeric value, text, or date/time.\n",
    "Formula: Apply formatting based on a custom formula or expression.\n",
    "Top/Bottom Rules: Format cells that are in the top or bottom percentages or values within a range.\n",
    "Data Bars: Display a gradient bar inside cells to represent the value.\n",
    "Color Scales: Apply a color scale to cells based on their values.\n",
    "Icon Sets: Display icons such as arrows, traffic lights, or shapes based on the cell's value.\n",
    "New Rule (Custom Format): Create custom rules using formulas, data bars, color scales, or icon sets.\n",
    "Each of these types of conditions provides a flexible way to apply conditional formatting to your data, allowing you to visually highlight important information or trends in your worksheet. You can choose the type of condition that best suits your data and formatting requirements."

    "Ans-Text commands in Excel, often referred to as text functions, allow you to manipulate and analyze text data in various ways. These functions can perform tasks such as extracting specific parts of text, combining text from multiple cells, converting text to different formats, and more. Here are some commonly used text functions in Excel along with examples of how to use them:\n",
    "\n",
    "CONCATENATE: Combines multiple text strings into one.\n",
    "Syntax: =CONCATENATE(text1, [text2], ...)\n",
    "Example: =CONCATENATE(\"Hello\", \" \", \"World\") returns \"Hello World\".\n",
    "LEFT: Returns a specified number of characters from the beginning of a text string.\n",
    "Syntax: =LEFT(text, num_chars)\n",
    "Example: =LEFT(\"Excel\", 3) returns \"Exc\".\n",
    "RIGHT: Returns a specified number of characters from the end of a text string.\n",
    "Syntax: =RIGHT(text, num_chars)\n",
    "Example: =RIGHT(\"Excel\", 3) returns \"cel\".\n",
    "MID: Returns a specified number of characters from a text string, starting at a specified position.\n",
    "Syntax: =MID(text, start_num, num_chars)\n",
    "Example: =MID(\"Excel\", 2, 3) returns \"xce\".\n",
    "LEN: Returns the number of characters in a text string.\n",
    "Syntax: =LEN(text)\n",
    "Example: =LEN(\"Excel\") returns 5.\n",
    "FIND: Returns the starting position of one text string within another.\n",
    "Syntax: =FIND(find_text, within_text, [start_num])\n",
    "Example: =FIND(\"el\", \"Excel\") returns 2.\n",
    "SUBSTITUTE: Replaces occurrences of a specified substring within a text string with another substring.\n",
    "Syntax: =SUBSTITUTE(text, old_text, new_text, [instance_num])\n",
    "Example: =SUBSTITUTE(\"apple\", \"a\", \"b\") returns \"bpple\".\n",
    "To use these text functions, simply enter them into a cell in Excel and provide the necessary arguments. The result will be displayed in the cell where you entered the function. You can also combine text functions with other Excel functions and formulas to perform more complex text manipulation tasks."
